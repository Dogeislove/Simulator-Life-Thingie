This roadmap is highly simplified as i'll use this as a base-line for programming and creating an idea on how this should work. I won't do any 'feature creeping'
I'll just work on creating the sort of 'Life Simulator Engine'. 
Basic Road Map:
          (1) Create Character and Environment.
          (2) Have a start to finish playthrough (very bare bones)
          (3) Maybe add the interesting stuff here
         
         
         Character:
          Stats, Death, Family. Stuff like that.
