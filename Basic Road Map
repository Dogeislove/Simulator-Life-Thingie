This roadmap is highly simplified as i'll use this as a base-line for programming and creating an idea on how this should work.
Basic Road Map:
          (1) Create Character and Enviorment. 
          (2) Have a start to finish playthrough (very bare bones)
         
         
         
         Character:
          Stats, Death, Family. Stuff like that.
