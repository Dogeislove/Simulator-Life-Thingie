Heavily being edited. A concept than an actual thing currently. Read Road Map for my current plans. 
My Release Philosohpy:
  Any additions (if its minor or not) will be added as a new 'test release' version. think of it as writting something on paper.
Note: currently planned to be native to linux.
First 'real world' program. I'm an amatuar programmer, making a big project like this will be a heavy under-taking. If the game isn't how you expected it to be, keep in mind I have never had any expierence writting real-world software, rather VERY trivial ones. Check my github profile for the comparasion.
