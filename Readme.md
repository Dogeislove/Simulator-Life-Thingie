Currently in The Bastic Stage of Development.
Basic Wishlist:
(1)	Create Character
(2)	Stats
(3)	Somehow Manipulate those said Stats.
(4)	Eventual Death of Such Character.

Explaination and Reasoning:
	(3): what do i mean by manipulating said stats?
		Essentially, when aging up in bitlife stats are decreased or increased randomly.
		May be a challange to implement.
	(4): Death?
		Calculatinng death seems to be a bit of a troublesome thing.
